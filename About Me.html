            <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>y name is Gabriel Mutafchiev. I was born and raised in Varna, Bulgaria. In Bulgaria I learned English as a second language and at the age of 14, my family and I moved to Germany where I improved my English skills and learned German. As long as I know myself, I have always been a creative type of person interested in the amazing thing called art. At first, from an early age, I showed interest in drawing. Later, at the age of 15-16, I was introduced to the world of content creation and design. Since I liked creating and the idea of a creative job that gives you the opportunity to work from anywhere, I decided to become a designer. I applied for the only school in the city that had a design specialty. I studied design and almost everything related to it for three straight years. I am 21 years old now and am still sure that I am a person who likes to explore and try new things out, especially if they have something to do with art and creativity.</p>
